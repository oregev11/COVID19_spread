# COVID19_spread
The goal of this project is to visualize the spread of COVID19 (caused by SARS-CoV-2) in Israel.
The data is limited (at least by june 2020), as it is scraped from the MoH reports that are publised as excel sheets at the MoH Telegram Channel.

- the source *.xlsx sheets are stored in the excel_reports directory in a 'yy/mm/dd.csv' format.

-  01 update_100K_data_by_excels.ipyb notebook - update the 'CityDataPer100K.csv', originally generated by covid19data.co.il with the latest excel
   reports and output  'CityDataPer100KUpdated.csv'
-  02  corona_israel_v1.ipynb notebook: takes the data in 'CityDataPer100KUpdated.csv', combine it with the lamas 2018 data, and generate a
   series of images showing COVID19 geo spread in israel and a curve of total positive patients over time.
